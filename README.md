# Hi, I'm Dustin

## About me
I am a junior software developer who loves to try out new technologies. I also do digital art (just a little bit).

My current goals are:
- Improve my skills and deepend my knowledge in software development, especially in system design and architecture.
- Learn more about cloud-everyting
- Get better proficiency at golang (my current favourite language)
- Draw more.
